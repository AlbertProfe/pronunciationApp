### One-to-One Relationship in JPA: AppUser and GameProgress

**Bidirectional Relationship**

In this example, we have a <mark>bidirectional one-to-one relationship</mark> between `AppUser` and `GameProgress`. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **AppUser Entity:**
   
   java
   
   `@OneToOne(mappedBy = "user", cascade = CascadeType.ALL) private GameProgress gameProgress;`
   
   - This annotation indicates that each `AppUser` is associated with one `GameProgress`.
   
   - `mappedBy = "user"` specifies that `GameProgress` owns the relationship.
   
   - `cascade = CascadeType.ALL` means that operations on `AppUser` will cascade to the associated `GameProgress`.

2. **GameProgress Entity:**
   
   java
   
   `@OneToOne @JoinColumn(name = "user_id") private AppUser appUser;`
   
   - This annotation shows that each `GameProgress` is linked to one `AppUser`.
   
   - `@JoinColumn(name = "user_id")` creates a column in the `GameProgress` table to store the `AppUser`'s ID.

**Bidirectional vs Unidirectional**

Bidirectional (Current Setup):

- Both entities have a reference to each other.

- You can navigate from `AppUser` to `GameProgress` and vice versa.

- Useful when you need to access related data from both sides frequently.

Unidirectional (Alternative):

If we remove the `gameProgress` field from `AppUser`, it becomes unidirectional:

- Only `GameProgress` would have a reference to `AppUser`.

- You could navigate from `GameProgress` to `AppUser`, but not the other way around.

- Simpler, but limits navigation to one direction.

**Key Points**

- In a bidirectional relationship, one side must own the relationship (here, `GameProgress`).

- The non-owning side uses `mappedBy` to indicate the owning side's field name.

- Bidirectional relationships offer more flexibility but require careful management to maintain consistency.
