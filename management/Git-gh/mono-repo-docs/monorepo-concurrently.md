# Monorepo exectuing conucurrently



To execute a monorepo with React and Spring Boot branches on a local machine using Visual Studio Code for React and IntelliJ IDEA for Spring Boot, follow these steps:

## Repository Setup

1. Create a monorepo with two branches: one for React and one for Spring Boot.
2. Use a package manager like pnpm or yarn to manage dependencies at the root level.

## React Setup (Visual Studio Code)

1. In the React branch, create a new React app using Create React App or Vite.
2. Set up the project structure and install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-react-app
   cd my-react-app
   npm install
   ```
3. Add a script in the root `package.json` to run the React dev server:
   
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start:react": "cd my-react-app && npm start"
   }
   ```

## Spring Boot Setup (IntelliJ IDEA)

1. In the Spring Boot branch, create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
2. Set up the project structure and dependencies in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.
3. Create a simple REST controller to test the backend.
4. Add a script in the root `package.json` to run the Spring Boot server:
   
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start:spring": "./mvnw spring-boot:run"
   }
   ```

## Running Both Services

1. To run both services concurrently, you can use a tool like `concurrently`:
   
   ```bash
   npm install -g concurrently
   ```
2. Add a script in the root `package.json` to start both services:
   
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "concurrently \"npm run start:react\" \"npm run start:spring\""
   }
   ```
3. Run both services with a single command:
   
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## IDE Configuration

1. Open the React project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the Spring Boot project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Configure IntelliJ IDEA to run the Spring Boot application.
